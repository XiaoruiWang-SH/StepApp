1. What is the name of your app?
BestRunner

2. Which problem does the app solve? (Max. 200 characters)
The app tracks and records running data, provides detailed statistical analysis of performance, and offers personalized training plans to improve fitness and running efficiency.

3. How does your app solve this problem? (Max. 650 characters)
We address this problem in the following ways:

* Recording running data: The app uses mobile phone sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, to detect steps, and GPS to track distance and route. This provides comprehensive data on each run.
* Displaying statistical analysis: It presents key metrics like distance, time, pace, and HRV in daily, weekly, and monthly visual graphs. The app also integrates Google Maps SDK to display running routes.
* Personalized training plans: Using AI technology, the app generates tailored training plans based on users' current running data and their goals, optimizing their performance and progress.

4. Why is this problem relevant? (Max. 300 characters)
This problem is relevant because runners want to track their performance and monitor improvements over time. Having access to detailed running data allows them to understand their progress, while scientifically tailored training plans help them enhance their performance effectively.

5. Do other apps exist to solve this (or a very similar) problem?
yes

6. If you answered yes to question 5, list the existing apps that are most related to yours
and explain how these solutions differ from your own. If you answered no to question 5,
explain why do you think nobody else has solved this problem before. (Max. 650 characters)
Yes, several apps address similar problems, including Garmin Connect, Coros, and Strava. While these apps offer a broad range of features covering various sports and activities, they tend to be more comprehensive and less specialized. In contrast, our app focuses exclusively on running, providing a streamlined and user-friendly experience. We prioritize running-specific data, in-depth analysis, and personalized training plans, without the distraction of unrelated features. This focus allows runners to get the most relevant insights and guidance for their performance improvement.

7. Which of the built-in sensors of your phone does the app make use of? (Max. 200 char.)
The app utilizes mobile phone sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope to detect steps, and GPS to track distance and routes. It also connects to the server via Wi-Fi or cellular network to request personalized training plans.

8. Which of the built-in actuators of your phone does the app make use of? (Max. 200 char.)
The app uses the vibration motor and speaker. Upon starting a run, the phone vibrates to confirm the process has begun. During the run, the app announces key metrics like distance and pace at every kilometer, allowing users to stay informed without checking their phone.

9. Does your app store sensor data locally, remotely, or in both ways?
locally.

10. Motivate your answer to question 9 (i.e., explain why your app stores data and why it
does so only locally/remotely or in both ways). (Max. 650 characters)
Our app stores data locally to display statistical analysis and generate visual graphs for users. Additionally, it analyzes training data to create personalized plans. We choose to store data locally for two main reasons: First, local storage is sufficient for our needs without the necessity of sending data remotely. Second, it enhances security, as keeping data on the device reduces potential risks associated with remote storage. Therefore, storing data locally is the best option for both functionality and privacy.
